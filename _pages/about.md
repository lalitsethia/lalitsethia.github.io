I am Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Economics at Boston University. I am an applied economist specializing in international, and macroeconomics. I leverage large datasets and creative empirical strategies to identify statistical and causal relationships. I also develop and calibrate quantitative models for counterfactual analysis. Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I worked for over two years in healthcare investment banking with UBS's India development office. 

I am on the job market for opportunity in data scientist, quantitative research, and consulting. You can find my [resume here](https://lalitsethia.github.io//files/Resume.pdf).

Kindly reach out for interviews over lalit@bu.edu.

**Travel costs, and international trade**
I study the relevance of business travel costs on international trade. I show that visa requirements are non-trivial and are significantly associated with lower trade. I also emphasize that non-business travel accounts for close to 80\% of international travel, and is therefore an important determinant of business travel cost. Motivated by these facts, I develop a model of international trade with heterogeneous firms where firms must undertake business travel to export. The model incorporates a travel sector that supplies travel services to both tourists and business travelers, and so price of travel is determined in equilibrium. In the model, travel costs affect the extensive margin of firm participation to export. I calibrate the model to closely match international trade flows. I simulate two counterfactual scenarios: (i) decreased travel costs via improved airplane technology and (ii) reduced fixed costs through relaxed visa policies. Preliminary findings indicate that a 25\% reduction in travel costs between China and the EU due to lenient visa policies increases trade by 2.3\%, while a 30\% enhancement in airplane efficiency globally boosts trade by an average of 1.3\%.
