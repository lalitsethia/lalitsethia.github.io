I graduated with a Ph.D. in Economics from Boston University in 2025 where my research was in international, and macroeconomics. Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I worked for over two years in healthcare investment banking with UBS's India development office. 

I have leveraged large datasets and creative empirical strategies to identify statistical and causal relationships. I also developed and calibrate quantitative models for counterfactual analysis. 

I joined the Retail Model Development team at Truist Bank in December 2024. <!--You can find my [resume here](https://lalitsethia.github.io//files/Resume.pdf).-->
