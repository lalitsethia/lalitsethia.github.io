## Working Papers
### [The impact of visas on international travel.](https://lalitsethia.github.io/files/jmp.pdf) ((JMP, significantly revised draft coming soon))

I study the relevance of business travel costs on international trade. I show that visa requirements are non-trivial and are significantly associated with lower trade. I also emphasize that non-business travel accounts for close to 80% of international travel and is therefore an important determinant of business travel cost. Motivated by these facts, I develop a model of international trade with heterogeneous firms where firms must undertake business travel to export. The model incorporates a travel sector that provides travel services to both tourists and business travelers, so the price of travel is determined in equilibrium. In the model, travel costs affect the extensive margin of firm participation to export. I calibrate the model to closely match international trade flows. I simulate two counterfactual scenarios: (i) reduced travel costs through improved airplane technology, and (ii) reduced fixed costs through relaxed visa policies. Preliminary findings indicate that a 25% reduction in travel costs between China and the EU due to lenient visa policies increases trade by 2.3%, while a 30% enhancement in airplane efficiency globally boosts trade by an average of 1.3%.

### Child labor supply and NREGS in India (Draft available upon request)
I quantify the intent-to-treat effects of the presence of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) on child labor outcomes. Little to no empirical literature exists evaluating the effects on child labor decision upon exogenous changes in adult labor supply. I use a Difference-in-Difference (DID) strategy along with child fixed-effects and the older cohort of Young Lives India (YLI) panel data to identify the direction and magnitude of changes in child labor supply in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana (formerly Andhra Pradesh) due to the presence of NREGS. With the help of the detailed child time allocation data in YLI panel I differentiate between various types of labor activities and with staggered implementation of NREGS I look at changes in intensive and extensive margins of child labor across genders. I observe significant gender-wise differential effect of the treatment (presence of NREGS in a district) on labor supply to household chores, family (or household) enterprises and paid labor. While participation decreased for boys, there was a displacement of girls from labor from one form of activity to another. [comment]: <> (https://lalitsethia.github.io/files/childlabor.pdf)


## Work in Progress
### Determinants of IT adoption (Draft in progress)
I construct detailed factory-level data from India and show that IT investments increased disproportionately with firm size,  that is, the intensity of IT use increases with scale. This suggests that they gain more from a fall in IT prices, as witnessed during the export-driven IT boom in India and could have increased their market share.
